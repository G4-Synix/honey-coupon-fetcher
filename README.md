# Honey Coupon Fetcher
This script was made because of honey's [predatory practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vc4yL3YTwWk), and allows you to grab coupons from their API without having to use their extension
Script may not be perfect, it was made in less than 15 minutes but it works for now (as of 22/12/24)
